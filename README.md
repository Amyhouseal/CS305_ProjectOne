SNHU CS-305 Project One

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting firm that develops customized financial plans for their clients. Artemis       Financial is looking to modernize their operations by using the most current and effective software security. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Using the static testing, I was able to successfully identify any vulnerabilities. Because Artemis Financial deals with sensitive information from their clients, such as payment information, bank account information and social security numbers, it is extremely important that these programs are coded securely to protect that information. Software security is adds integrity and realiability to the companies overall wellbeing. This gives assurance to the companies clients that their information is protected.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I found the manual review of the code to be specifically challenging. Reviewing code you are unfamiliar with takes some times to understand it's purpose. Once I was able to do that, I was able to successfully review the code vulnerabilities.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase the layers of security I used the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram to assess what areas needed special attention based on what the company wants to accomplish. In the future I would continue to use this diagram to help me to decide what techniques to use. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To make certain the code and software was function and secure, I re-ran the dependency check. I also made sure there were no errors within the code.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I utilized the internet to confirm current practices.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
In the future, I would show my evaluation of the areas of security from this assignment.
